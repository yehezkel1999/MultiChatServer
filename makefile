# makefile cheat sheet:
#
# VERY IMPORTANT: makefiles are whitespace sensitive, meaning that 
# unaligned text and/or random whitespaces can cause it not to work,
# so if everything looks proper and it still doesn't work it's probably
# that.
# 
# target: dependencies
# 	commands
#
# when the dependencies change the target gets generated by executing
# the given commands.
# 
# $@: name of the target being generated.
# $<: first dependency.
# $^: all of the dependencies.
# $(VARIABLE): use a variable'
#
# *: search file system for matching file names
# %: either matches one or more characters in a string, replaces the 
# 	 matched string with a string, or used in rule definitions in some 
# 	 functions.
#
# wildcard: generates a space seperated list of names of the existing
# 			files that match one of the given file name patterns.
# patsubst: takes a string to replace, what to replace it with, and a 
# 			list of files, and replaces the strings accourdingly.
# 
# compiler flags:
# -c: create an object file rather than an executable.
# -o: create an executable with a name.
# -g: debug flag
# -Wall: enables compiler warnings
